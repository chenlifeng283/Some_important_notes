# The basic for a new user

- As a new user you can get started without understanding the technical details.
- Once,you've installed a Bitcoin wallet on your computer or mobile phone,it will generate your fisrt Bitcoin Address,
  and you can create whenever you need one.
- You can disclose your addresses to your freinds so that they can pay you or vice versa.
- In fact ,it pretty similar to how email works,except that Bitcoin addresses should be used only once.

# Balance--block chain

- The block chain is a **shared public ledger** on which the entire Bitcoin network relies.
- All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain.
- It allow Bitcoin wallets calculate their spandable balance so that new transactions can be verified thereby ensuring 
  they're actually owned by the spander.
- The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with crpytography.

# Transactions--private keys

- A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. 
- Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called **private keys or seed**,which is used to sign transactions,
  providing a mathermatical proof that they have come from the own of the wallet.
- The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued.
- All transaction are broadcast to the network and usually begin to be confirmed within 10-20 minutes,through a
  process called mining.
  
# Processing--mining

- Mining is a **distributed consensus system** that is used to confirm pending transaction by including them in the block chain.
- It enforces a chronological order in the block chain,protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers
  to agree on the state of the system. 
- Transaction must be packed in a block that fits very strict crpytographic rules that will be verified by the network.
- There rules prevent previous block from being modified because doing so would invalidate all the subsenquent blocks.
- Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks
  consecutively to the block chain.
- In this way, no group and individual can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to 
  roll back their own spends.

# Going down the rabbit hole

- This is just a short summary of Bitcoin. If you want to learn more the details, you can read the original paper that
  describes its design, the developer documentation, or explore the Bitcoin wiki.
